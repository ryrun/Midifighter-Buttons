#+TITLE:Midifighter-Buttons Tool for Renoise

* 1. What is it

Its a simple renoise tool to setup the button leds of the midifighter
3d device. It uses the sample mappings of the current selected
instrument and activates the leds on the corresponding buttons. It uses
the mute groups of the sample mapping to determine the color for the
button. So mappings with the same mute group will have the same color.

* 2. How to use it

The first sample mapping should start at C4. Just map each sample you
want to play to one of the notes, that the midi fighter can trigger.
Use mute groups to color the leds. For drum you can use mute group 1
which will be colored blue.

When you are done, then just send the current mapping to the midi
fighter via Mainmenu->Tools->Set midifighter button leds ...  You can also
create a keyboard shortcut for it.

Please note, the global octave have impact on the incoming midi notes
and it should be set to 5.
